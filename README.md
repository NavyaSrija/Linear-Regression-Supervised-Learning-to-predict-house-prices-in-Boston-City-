# Linear-Regression-Supervised-Learning-to-predict-house-prices-in-Boston-City-
We’ll implement the linear regression machine learning algorithm using the Boston housing price sample data. As with all ML algorithms, we’ll start with importing our dataset and then train our algorithm using historical data.

Linear regression is a predictive model often used by real businesses. Linear regression seeks to predict the relationship between a scalar response and related explanatory variables to output value with realistic meaning like product sales or housing prices.

From a mathematical point of view, linear regression is about fitting data to minimize the sum of residuals between each data point and the predicted value. In other words, we are minimizing the discrepancy between the data and the estimation model.
